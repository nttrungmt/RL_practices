    They call this with x.shape = (n,2). The first column indicates the return
    for the +eps_i case, the second for the -eps_i case (mirrored sampling).
    Each time a roll-out happens, they append [rews_pos, rews_neg] to a list,
    which they then vertically concatenate to get to (n,2), so n must indicate
    the npop parameter (or maybe half of it).

    This will make the maximum score have a rank of 0.5, the smallest score have
    a rank of -0.5, and all other values get ranks uniformly distributed in
    (-0.5, 0.5), with ties broken based on the order from np.argsort().

    The OpenAI code, for each generated +eps_i noise vector, the weight for that
    vector is actually (F_i-F_i') where F_i' is the result from negating that
    vector. So when they do the update, they don't "use" the -eps_i vector. It's
    just the +eps_i vector with a *weight* that takes into account the negative
    case. Actually that seems right to me, if the weight is negative then we
    would have wanted -eps_i and that would be encouraged.

    See their `batched_weighted_sum` method, which takes as its first argument a
    vector of length (n,) where n is presumably npop. Each component in that
    vector represents an F_i-F_i' term. They then do a (1,n)*(n,numparams)
    matrix multiply to get a final (1,numparam) weight update.

    Finally, they *further* divide that vector by (n*2) before feeding it to the
    update. That should represent the (1/npop) which I've been doing.
