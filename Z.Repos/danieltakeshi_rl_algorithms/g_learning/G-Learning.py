G-Learning, as described in:

    Taming the Noise in Reinforcement Learning via Soft Updates (UAI 2016)
    Authors: Roy Fox*, Ari Pakman*, Naftali Tishby

This code will face the same constraints as Denny Britz's code, i.e. we need
simple tabular scenarios. I have tested G-learning on the following:

1. CliffWorldEnv. It runs, but the results seem to be worse than Q-learning.
